# Project Piltover

To make this project work you have to change the property `riot.api.key`. You can do that in the application.properties or pass the property via command line.

The dependency 'riot-api-java' is not yet in the Maven Central Repository. To get this project running you have to check out **https://github.com/taycaldwell/riot-api-java**
and build it once with Maven. After that the artifact is in your local repository and you can go on.
